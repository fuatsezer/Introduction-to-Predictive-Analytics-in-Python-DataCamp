# Variable selection: motivation
Drawbacks of models with many variables:
* Overfitting
* Hard to maintain or implement
* Hard to interpret, multi-collinearity
# Model evaluation: AUC
Near to 1 -> Better model
# The forward stepwise variable selection
* Empty set
* Find the best variable v1
* Find the best variable v2 in combination with v1
* Find best variable v3 in combination with v1, v2
* ...........

( Until all variables are added or until predifined number of variables added)
